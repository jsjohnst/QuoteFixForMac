Installing QuoteFix
===================

- build the plug-in:
  python setup.py py2app
- copy or move dist/QuoteFix.mailbundle to ~/Library/Mail/Bundles/

If you're hacking the code, you can use py2app's '-A' commandline option to
make 'alias builds', which build much faster and are much smaller. However,
these are pinned to your local setup to make sure to remove the '-A' when
you're making a distribution build.
