Installing QuoteFix
===================

- build the plug-in:
  python setup.py py2app
- copy or move dist/QuoteFix.mailbundle to ~/Library/Mail/Bundles/

If you're hacking the code, you can use py2app's '-A' commandline option to
make 'alias builds', which build much faster and are much smaller. However,
these are pinned to your local setup to make sure to remove the '-A' when
you're making a distribution build.

Snow Leopard notes
------------------

In Snow Leopard, mail plug-ins must declare, in their Info.plist, with
which versions of Mail.app en Message.framework they are compatible with.
See the 'plist' dict in setup.py (the 'SupportedPluginCompatibilityUUIDs'
key).
